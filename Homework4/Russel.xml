         <p>Words and Meaning </p>

         <p>always a greater or less degree of vagueness. The meaning is an area, like a target : it
            may have a bull's eye, but the outlying parts of the target are still more or less
            within the meaning, in a gradually diminishing degree as we travel further from the
            bull's eye. As language grows more precise, there is less and less of the target outside
            the bull's eye, and the bull's eye itself grows smaller and smaller; but the bull's eye
            never shrinks to a point, and there is always a doubtful region, however small,
            surrounding it.On the understanding of words, a very admirable little book is Ribot's
            Evolution of General Ideas, Open Court Co., 1899. Ribot says (p. 131): <quote source="Ribot,  1899, Evolution of General Ideas, Open Court Co., p. 131">"We learn to
            understand a concept as we learn to walk, dance, fence or play a musical instrument: it
            is a habit, i.e. an organized memory. General terms cover an organized, latent knowledge
            which is the hidden capital without which we should be in a state of bankruptcy,
            manipulating false money or paper of no value. General ideas are habits in the
            intellectual order."</quote></p>

         <p>A word is used <term xml:id ="cor" rend="quoted">"correctly"</term> <gloss target="#cor">when the average hearer will be affected by it in the way
            intended</gloss>. This is a psychological, not a literary, of <term xml:id = "litcor" rend="quoted">"correctness."</term> The literary
            definition would substitute, for the average hearer, <gloss target="#litcor">a person of high education living a
            long time ago</gloss>; the purpose of this definition is to make it difficult to speak or write
            correctly.</p>

         <p>The relation of a word to its meaning is of the nature of a causal law governing our use
            of the word and our actions when we hear it used. There is no more reason why a person
            who uses a word correctly should be able to tell what it means than there is why a
            planet which is moving correctly should know Kepler's laws.</p>

         <p>To illustrate what is meant by <hi rend="quoted">"understanding"</hi> words and sentences, let us take
            instances of various situations.</p>

         <p>Suppose you are walking in London with an absent-minded friend, and while crossing a
            street you say, <said aloud = "true">"Look out, there's a motor coming."</said> He will glance round and jump aside
            without the need of any <hi rend="quoted">" mental "</hi> intermediary. There need be no <hi rend="quoted">"ideas,"</hi> but only a
            stiffening of the muscles, followed quickly by action. He <hi rend="quoted">"understands "</hi> the words,
            because he does the right thing. Such <hi rend="quoted">"understanding "</hi> may be taken to belong to the
            nerves and brain, being habits which they have acquired while the language was being
            learnt. Thus understanding in this sense may be reduced to mere physiological causal
            laws.</p>

         <p>If you say the same thing to a Frenchman with a slight knowledge of English he will go
            through some inner speech which may be represented by <said aloud="false">"<foreign xml:lang="fr">Que dit-il ? Ah, oui, une
            automobile</foreign> !"</said> After this, the rest follows as with the Englishman. Watson would contend
            that the inner speech must be incipiently pronounced; we should argue that it might be
            merely imaged. But this point is not important in the present connection. </p>

         <p>If you say the same thing to a child who does not yet know the word <term rend="quoted">"motor,"</term> but does
            know the other words you are using, you produce a feeling of anxiety and doubt: you will
            have to point and say, <said aloud="true">"There, that's a motor."</said> After that the child will roughly
            understand the word <term rend="quoted">"motor,"</term> though he may include trains and steam-rollers If this is
            the first time the child has heard the word <term rend="quoted">"motor,"</term> he may for a long time continue to
            recall this scene when he hears the word. </p>

         <p>So far we have found four ways of understanding words: <lb/> (1) On suitable occasions you use
            the word properly. <lb/> (2) When you hear it you act appropriately <lb/> (3) You associate the word
            with another word (say in a different language) which has the appropriate effect on
            behaviour. <lb/> (4) When the word is being first learnt, you may associate it with an object,
            which is what it <hi rend="quoted">" means"</hi> or a representative of various objects that it <hi rend="quoted">"means."</hi></p>
